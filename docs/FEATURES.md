# ChatMarker - Feature Documentation

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-01
**Status**: WhatsApp & Reddit Fully Implemented

## Philosophy

ChatMarker uses a **chat-only marking system** where you mark entire conversations rather than individual messages. This approach:

- **Reduces clutter** - No need to mark every message in a conversation
- **Simplifies organization** - One mark per chat keeps things clean
- **Matches user intent** - Most people want to track conversations, not individual messages
- **Better performance** - Less DOM manipulation, faster page loads

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Chat-Only Marking?

**Original Plan**: Mark individual messages
**Actual Implementation**: Mark entire chats

**Reasons:**
1. **User research**: Most people want to track conversations, not messages
2. **Simplicity**: One mark per chat is cleaner than many marks per chat
3. **Performance**: Less DOM manipulation, faster experience
4. **Visual clarity**: No clutter from many markers
5. **Platform differences**: Message IDs are unstable across platforms

### Why Side Panel Instead of Popup?

**Popup**: Small window that closes when you click away
**Side Panel**: Persistent sidebar that stays open

**Reasons:**
1. **Better workspace**: More room to view marked chats
2. **Multi-tasking**: Keep dashboard open while browsing
3. **Modern UX**: Side panels are the future of extensions
4. **Persistent state**: Doesn't close when switching tabs

### Why Local-Only Storage?

**Cloud Sync**: Data synced across devices
**Local-Only**: Data stays on your device

**Reasons:**
1. **Privacy-first**: Your conversations stay private
2. **No backend**: No server costs, simpler architecture
3. **Offline-first**: Works without internet
4. **No login**: Start using immediately
5. **GDPR compliant**: No data leaves your device
